This repository have results of task given by CODSOFT during Internship

Task : 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction - In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the passenger survival and I have used the Titanic dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website as per Codsoft instructions for this project, I have implemented Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn and built a model to predict whether the passenger survived or not by training a binary classification model using Logistic Regression.

Task : 2 - Movie Rating Prediction - Here, I built a machine learning model for Movie Rating Prediction for the IMDB dataset from the Kaggle. In this project, I have implemented Linear Regression technique for the prediction. Firstly we have proceesed the data and visualized it with multiple chart for analysis then made feature engineering to make the data ready for model. Finally we have rated our model performance with evaluation metrics.
